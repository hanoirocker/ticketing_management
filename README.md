## Description

This project is meant to demostrate how a simple application such as this one can be modularized / devided into separted microservices, and how to solve data sharing between all of them.

For this specific version we'll be using Kubernetes to create each cluster and manage pods, deployments, services, etc .. and pointing at docker engine on local. This orquestration could also be approached as an alternative for lower performance hardware users by building all of these clusters on some cloud provider.
